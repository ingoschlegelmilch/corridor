# Corridor with CSS Grid
---

## Introduction
---
This is meant to be a little exercise to familiarize with CSS grid and so I got the idea to create an illusion of going back and forth a corridor with walls/doors along the way displaying various content, think of it as some kind of slideshow.

## How to use
---
In the current version you need to use the mousewheel to scroll either up for moving forward/growing the box in the center or down for moving backward/shrinking the box in the center.

## Known-issues
---
On certain dimensions of the center container there are white spaces revealing part of the grid layout, not sure how and if this can be resolved.
